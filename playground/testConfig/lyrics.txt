Oh, what they think about you
Oh, what they think about you
Prepare to leave my body when the time it comes through
Loving on you
'Til the time, it comes through
Why you always hate to break bread?
Think about the way that you would feel if never said
Joke's on you
Well it's time to come through
Well If she had to choose
Me or her mom
I know I wouldn't last long, yeah
No problem with the truth
