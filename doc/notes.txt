Apparently, to create a dts-gen for a scoped package, (one with @ already in front of it), you need to create a directory in root called @whatever, and it wont crash.

eg dts-gen -m @ffmpeg-installer/ffmpeg needs an @ffmpeg-installer dir in root. it's weird but it works

for some fucked reason, I need to keep @ffmpeg-installer folder top level idk and idc
