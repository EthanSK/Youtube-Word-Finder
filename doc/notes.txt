Apparently, to create a dts-gen for a scoped package, (one with @ already in front of it), you need to create a directory in root called @whatever, and it wont crash.

eg dts-gen -m @ffmpeg-installer/ffmpeg needs an @ffmpeg-installer dir in root. it's weird but it works

for some fucked reason, I need to keep @ffmpeg-installer folder top level idk and idc


# To start dev env

- In one shell, do npm run react-start
- Once that's loaded, in another shell, do npm run dev

# For setting up with typescript, electron, and react:

- in view package json, homepage must be set to . or it won't work.
- if importing ipc, do it like this https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/9920#issuecomment-511162952

IF YOU REFERENCE A FILE FROM THE VIEW FOLDER, IT WILL TRY AND TSC IT AND PUT IT IN THE DIST

an npm module with @ in name is called a scoped package

to share types, add the exact file of the shared types file in tsconfig   "files": ["customTypes/shared-types.d.ts"]




on windows, do npm install from a terminal that as running as administrator, or ffmpeg won't install....ffs i fucking hate stupid windows.
Also, make sure on node 16 or might get issues
