Getting video info from video url:

youtube-dl https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGt-BZ-SxGI --write-info-json --max-downloads 3 --skip-download


Getting youtube video info from channel:

youtube-dl https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-lHJZR3Gqxm24_Vd_AJ5Yw --write-info-json --skip-download --ignore-errors --playlist-end 3

 --playlist-end is what makes it go much faster


 ^^This, but with subtitles (sub urls found in metadata file):

 youtube-dl https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-lHJZR3Gqxm24_Vd_AJ5Yw  --write-info-json --skip-download --ignore-errors --playlist-end 1 --write-sub --write-auto-sub

(Don't do this tho - it's better to use youtube-dl to download the subs as opposed to downloading them from the url manually)
